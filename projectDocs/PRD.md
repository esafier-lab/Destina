# Destina — AI Travel Planner

## 1. Executive Summary  
**Destina** is an AI-powered web app that creates personalized, budget-based itineraries in seconds.  
Users enter their destination, dates, budget, group size, and trip style (fun, cultural, or religious).  
The app suggests food, lodging, and activities, calculates total costs, and lets users edit and track their trip.  
**Problem:** Planning trips is stressful, scattered across websites, and rarely aligned with personal budgets or styles.

## 2. Problem Statement & Opportunity  
Planning a trip today requires juggling dozens of tabs: flight sites, hotel lists, restaurant reviews, and maps.  
Travelers waste hours comparing prices and reading guides—especially those with budgets, kids, or dietary/religious needs.  
Current tools like Google Travel or TripAdvisor either overwhelm with data or offer rigid templates that don't adapt to individual preferences.  

**Opportunity:** Build an AI-powered planner that produces complete, editable itineraries within one minute—organized by budget and purpose—helping travelers save time, stress less, and plan smarter.
